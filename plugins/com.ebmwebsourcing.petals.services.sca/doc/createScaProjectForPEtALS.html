<h1>Creating an SCA project for Petals</h1>

<p>

<b>Use SCA</b> in the <b>Petals &gt; Use a technical service</b> category.

On the first page, double-click the version to target.<br />

<p>
The generated project is an SCA Java project. It owns the Petals nature, so it can be
used the Petals Eclipse tooling. The wizard has generated a composite file and its diagram.
There is no jbi.xml file. This is normal. You will generate it once you have finished your
SCA application (the jbi.xml content depends the SCA application <i>shape</i>).
